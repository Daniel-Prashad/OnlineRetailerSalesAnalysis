# Online Retailer Sales Analysis

This project uses Python to randomly generate sales data for an online retailer including order, customer, product, shipping and pricing details. The raw sales data is then written to an Excel spreadsheet where it is cleaned and transformed in preparation for analysis. The analysis done in Excel details various aspects of the online retailerâ€™s lifetime sales by year, product brand and destined country using various aggregations, if statements, lookups, filtering, conditional formatting, pivot tables and in-depth interactive dashboards to showcase the findings.
